A web application for a school project - Development of a Software Application for Teaching Computer Networking.

Work in progress.

Built in JavaScript, with [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/).

Code for weighted graph implemented with reference to this article by Maiko Miyazaki: [Completed JavaScript Data Structure Course, and Here is What I Learned About Graph (+ Dijkstra Algorithm)](https://dev.to/maikomiyazaki/completed-javascript-data-structure-course-and-here-is-what-i-learned-about-graph-dijkstra-algorithm-57n8).

Tested on Firefox version 86.0 and Chrome version 88.0.4324.190.
